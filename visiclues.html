<b>What am I doing here?</b>
<p style="margin-left: 25px;">
You're fulfilling a mandatory 'volunteer' requirement for your ethics class so you don't have to go to summer school. Mr. Jorry, the 
hospital CFO, was going to give you your letter confirming your successful completion tonight, your last night. But now he's turned 
up dead under suspicious circumstances, with no trace of your letter. So you'll probably need to figure out who killed 
him in order to find your letter and avoid summer school. You also need to collect eight signatures from hospital staff and patients.

<b>How do I get the security card from Buzz?</b><br>
<details><summary>1.</summary>He won't let you take it as long as he's sitting there.</details>
<details><summary>2.</summary>Is there a way to get him to leave?</details>
<details><summary>3.</summary>He sure is blasting through those boiled shrimp.</details>
<details><summary>4.</summary>Have you found the rancid shrimp in the kitchen garbage can?</details>
<details><summary>5.</summary>If you show him the rancid shrimp he'll heedlessly eat it.</details>
<details><summary>6.</summary>He'll make a mad dash for the restroom and out of the story. Mean but effective.</details>

<br><b>Sub-Basement</b><br>
<details><summary>1.</summary>The security card will let you get into the sub-basement via the service elevator.</details>
<details><summary>2.</summary>But the service elevator doesn't seem to be working.</details>
<details><summary>3.</summary>Maybe you should check in Engineering.</details>
<details><summary>4.</summary>If you open the fusebox you'll see the problem.</details>
<details><summary>5.</summary>Somebody apparently doesn't want people using the service elevator tonight.</details>
<details><summary>6.</summary>While in the service elevator 'swipe card through reader' or simply 'swipe card'.</details>
<details><summary>7.</summary>Once down there you'll find your way to the boiler room.</details>
<details><summary>8.</summary>Search the denim jacket and you'll find a syringe. That's odd.</details>

<br><b>Vic</b><br>
<details><summary>1.</summary>Vic, the suspicious hood, keeps taking whatever I bring out of the boiler room.</details>
<details><summary>2.</summary>There's a dumbwaiter right there.</details>
<details><summary>3.</summary>The right chain lowers the cab, the left raises it.</details>
<details><summary>4.</summary>You can put the syringe in the cab, then send it up. It'll be there later when you 
    go back upstairs.</details>

<br><b>The Syringe</b><br>
<details><summary>1.</summary>Have you showed the syringe to anybody?</details>
<details><summary>2.</summary>Nurse Retch seems kind of sketchy?</details>
<details><summary>3.</summary>If you show it to her, she'll slip away to the basement.</details>
<details><summary>4.</summary>Maybe if you get there before she does?</details>
<details><summary>5.</summary>There's a locker there suitable for skulking.</details>
<details><summary>6.</summary>Beat her there and get in the locker. She'll sneak in, call someone on the phone, then 
    slip something into the metal cabinet.</details>

<br><b>The Cabinet</b><br>
<details><summary>1.</summary>But now I can't open the stupid cabinet.</details>
<details><summary>2.</summary>If you were watching Nurse Retch from the locker, you saw her hit the door in
    a specific spot. "Hit the door" and it will open. Take the vial of potassium chloride.</details>

<br><b>Northrup's Office</b><br>
<details><summary>1.</summary>How do I get this Dr. Northrup guy to come out of his office?</details>
<details><summary>2.</summary>Don't go any further until you have the vial of potassium.</details>
<details><summary>3.</summary>Have you shown it to anyone?</details>
<details><summary>4.</summary>If you show it to Nurse Retch, she gets pretty angry and then storms off.</details>
<details><summary>5.</summary>Maybe you should follow her.</details>
<details><summary>6.</summary>Follow her to Northrup. You'll interupt a meeting and get kicked out. But Northrup will 
leave the office and lock it behind him. </details>
<details><summary>7.</summary>So now how do I get in?</details>
<details><summary>8.</summary>Have you noticed the gap in the drop ceiling in the hallway. There's probably a space 
above it.</details>
<details><summary>9.</summary>There's a ladder in Engineering. You can open it and drop it under the appropriate spot. Then climb up 
and around to Northrup's office.</details>

<br><b>Flashlight</b><br>
<details><summary>1.</summary>It's dark in the ceiling. Where's a light?</details>
<details><summary>2.</summary>Have you met Mabel, the lady at the information desk? She seems helpful.</details>
<details><summary>3.</summary>She especially seems to like the romance novels you bring her on your cart.</details>
<details><summary>4.</summary>As soon as you roll the book cart into the lobby, she'll give you a flashlight.</details>

<br><b>Jorry's Office</b><br>
<details><summary>1.</summary>How do I get into the deceased guy's office? The door is locked.</details>
<details><summary>2.</summary>It's a reasonable assumption that Freddy, the security guard has the key.</details>
<details><summary>3.</summary>He won't give it up willingly, though.</details>
<details><summary>4.</summary>He apparently has a propensity to fall asleep easily at any time.</details>
<details><summary>5.</summary>Have you found anything that could be at all sedating?</details>
<details><summary>6.</summary>Eugene gave you an 'Air Supply' tape. It's on his desk in the basement.</details>
<details><summary>7.</summary>Put the tape in your walkman and then offer it to him. He'll put it on, listen, and 
    immediately fall dead asleep.</details>
<details><summary>8.</summary>Search him for the key. Don't forget to take your walkman back.</details>

<br><b>The Safe</b><br>
<details><summary>1.</summary>There are two safes.</details>
<details><summary>2.</summary>The safe in Jorry's office is open and empty.</details>
<details><summary>3.</summary>The one in Northrup's office is securely locked.</details>
<details><summary>4.</summary>Don't go any further until you've gotten into Jorry's office.</a>.</details>
<details><summary>5.</summary>Have you looked in the aquarium?</details>
<details><summary>6.</summary>There's a cassette tape hidden under the rock.</details>
<details><summary>7.</summary>Play it and you'll hear Jorry explain everything. And he'll tell you the combination as well.</details>
<details><summary>8.</summary>Inside the safe you'll find an incriminating ledger that Northrup will do anything to get back.</details>


<br><b>Endgame</b><br>
<details><summary>1.</summary>Northrup, Retch, and Vic keep stalking and catching me.</details>
<details><summary>2.</summary>You're unarmed. Is there anything you could somehow weaponize?</details>
<details><summary>3.</summary>Have you been in the MRI suite? An MRI scanner is just a huge magnet and the signs on the 
    wall describe how dangerous it can be to have metal nearby.</details>
<details><summary>4.</summary>Have you seen anything metal that might make a weapon?</details>
<details><summary>5.</summary>There's a metal cart stacked with metal oxygen cannisters in central supply.</details>
<details><summary>6.</summary>Push the cart into the MRI scanner sometime early in the game.</details>
<details><summary>7.</summary>Later, when the bad guys are following you, go to the MRI control room and press the 
    green button on the control desk. The scanner will start in five turns.</details>
<details><summary>8.</summary>Head into the scanner room and take cover in the access compartment. The bad guys will follow you in 
    and get pummeled when the MRI sequence initiates.</details>
<details><summary>9.</summary>When the dust clears your letter will be there among the battered villains. You have won, 
    assuming you've also gotten the eight signatures you need on your form.</details>

<br><b>Have You Tried?</b><br>
<details><summary>1.</summary>Playing the various tapes in the walkman? You can fast-forward, rewind, and flip the tapes over. 
    Be sure you're wearing the headphones to hear the music.</details>
<details><summary>2.</summary>Reading the magazines on your book cart?</details>
<details><summary>3.</summary>Dialing the telephone in the basement?</details>
<details><summary>4.</summary>Talking to Mabel about her favorite romance novels?</details>
<details><summary>5.</summary>Bursting through Northrup's ceiling while he's in his office?.</details>

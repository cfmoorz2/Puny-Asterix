<b>What am I doing here?</b>
<p style="margin-left: 25px;">
You're fulfilling a mandatory 'volunteer' requirement for your ethics class so you don't have to go to summer school. Mr. Jorry, the 
hospital CFO, was going to give you your letter confirming your successful completion tonight, your last night. But now he's turned 
up dead under suspicious circumstances, with no trace of your letter. So you'll probably need to figure out who killed 
him in order to find your letter and avoid summer school. You also need to collect eight signatures from hospital staff and patients.

<b>How do I get the security card from Buzz?</b><br>
<details><summary>1.</summary>He won't let you take it as long as he's sitting there.</details>
<details><summary>2.</summary>Is there a way to get him to leave?</details>
<details><summary>3.</summary>He sure is blasting through those boiled shrimp.</details>
<details><summary>4.</summary>Have you found the rancid shrimp in the kitchen garbage can?</details>
<details><summary>5.</summary>If you show him the rancid shrimp he'll heedlessly eat it.</details>
<details><summary>6.</summary>He'll make a mad dash for the restroom and out of the story. Mean but effective.</details>

<br><b>Sub-Basement</b><br>
<details><summary>1.</summary>The security card will let you get into the sub-basement via the service elevator.</details>
<details><summary>2.</summary>But the service elevator doesn't seem to be working.</details>
<details><summary>3.</summary>Maybe you should check in Engineering.</details>
<details><summary>4.</summary>If you open the fusebox you'll see the problem.</details>
<details><summary>5.</summary>Somebody apparently doesn't want people using the service elevator tonight.</details>
<details><summary>6.</summary>While in the service elevator 'swipe card through reader' or simply 'swipe card'.</details>
<details><summary>7.</summary>Once down there you'll find your way to the boiler room.</details>
<details><summary>8.</summary>Search the denim jacket and you'll find a syringe. That's odd.</details>

<br><b>Vic</b><br>
<details><summary>1.</summary>Vic, the suspicious hood, keeps taking the syringe from me.</details>
<details><summary>2.</summary>There's a dumbwaiter shaft right there.</details>
<details><summary>3.</summary>There's a helium balloon upstairs in Ms. Parson's room.</details>
<details><summary>4.</summary>You can tie the syringe to the balloon, then send it up the shaft. It'll be there later when you 
    go back upstairs.</details>

<br><b>The Syringe</b><br>
<details><summary>1.</summary>Have you showed the syringe to anybody?</details>
<details><summary>2.</summary>Nurse Retch seems kind of sketchy?</details>
<details><summary>3.</summary>If you show it to her, she'll slip away to the basement.</details>
<details><summary>4.</summary>Maybe you should follow her?</details>
<details><summary>5.</summary>You'll catch her hanging out near the metal cabinet.</details>
<details><summary>6.</summary>She'll leave and then you can look in the cabinet.</details>

<br><b>Northrup's Office</b><br>
<details><summary>1.</summary>How do I get Dr. Northrup to come out of his office?</details>
<details><summary>2.</summary>Don't go any further until you have the vial of potassium.</details>
<details><summary>3.</summary>Have you shown it to anyone?</details>
<details><summary>4.</summary>If you show it to Nurse Retch, she gets pretty angry and then storms off, again.</details>
<details><summary>5.</summary>Maybe you should follow her.</details>
<details><summary>6.</summary>She heads to Northrup's office but she'll shut the door behind her and you can't get in. </details>
<details><summary>7.</summary>So now how do I get in?</details>
<details><summary>8.</summary>Have you noticed the gap in the drop ceiling in the hallway. There's probably a space 
above it.</details>
<details><summary>9.</summary>There's a ladder in Engineering. You can open it and place it under the appropriate spot. Then climb up 
and around to Northrup's office.</details>

<br><b>Flashlight</b><br>
<details><summary>1.</summary>It's dark in the ceiling. Where's a light?</details>
<details><summary>2.</summary>Check the darkroom off of the x-ray suite.</details>

<br><b>Jorry's Office</b><br>
<details><summary>1.</summary>How do I get into the deceased guy's office? The door is locked.</details>
<details><summary>2.</summary>Freddy, the security guard, tells you he has the key.</details>
<details><summary>3.</summary>He won't give it up willingly, though.</details>
<details><summary>4.</summary>He's pretty exhausted and could fall asleep easily at any time.</details>
<details><summary>5.</summary>Have you found anything that could be at all sedating?</details>
<details><summary>6.</summary>Eugene gave you an 'Air Supply' tape. It's on his desk in the basement.</details>
<details><summary>7.</summary>Put the tape in your walkman and then offer it to Freddy. He'll put it on, listen, and 
    immediately fall dead asleep.</details>
<details><summary>8.</summary>Search him and don't forget to take your walkman back.</details>

<br><b>The Safe</b><br>
<details><summary>1.</summary>There are two safes.</details>
<details><summary>2.</summary>The safe in Jorry's office is open and empty.</details>
<details><summary>3.</summary>The one in Northrup's office is securely locked.</details>
<details><summary>4.</summary>Don't go any further until you've gotten into Jorry's office.</a>.</details>
<details><summary>5.</summary>Have you looked in the aquarium?</details>
<details><summary>6.</summary>There's a cassette tape hidden under the rock.</details>
<details><summary>7.</summary>Play it and you'll hear Jorry explain everything. And he'll tell you the combination as well.</details>
<details><summary>8.</summary>Inside the safe you'll find an incriminating ledger.</details>

<br><b>Endgame</b><br>
<details><summary>1.</summary>Lt. Worthless doesn't seem very competent.</details>
<details><summary>2.</summary>But he is a cop. You should probably show him whatever evidence or clues you find.</details>
<details><summary>3.</summary>He won't be very helpful but if you show him enough, his much more competent partner Lt. Rodriguez will
    show up and the baddies will get their just deserts.</details>
<details><summary>4.</summary>Show Worthless the syringe, the potassium vial, the ledger, and give him your walkman with Jorry's tape in it.</details>
<details><summary>5.</summary>Don't forget to take your completion letter at the end.</details>

<br><b>Have You Tried?</b><br>
<details><summary>1.</summary>Playing the various tapes in the walkman? You can fast-forward, rewind, and flip the tapes over. 
    Be sure you're wearing the headphones to hear the audio.</details>
<details><summary>2.</summary>Reading the magazines on your book cart?</details>
<details><summary>3.</summary>Dialing the telephone in the basement?</details>
<details><summary>4.</summary>Talking to Mabel about her favorite romance novels?</details>
<details><summary>5.</summary>Bursting through Northrup's ceiling while he's in his office?.</details>

  30 "St. Asterix Hospital" TM_NO_LINE "I suppose I've been here most of my life, first as a nurse and now doing this. Don't get me started on 
  the people running it these days, though."
  30 "Dr. Northrup" TM_NO_LINE "She frowns. My Momma told me not to deal in rumors. But I think that doctor has been running this place 
  into the ground. It almost seems deliberate."
  30 "Sid Jorry" TM_NO_LINE "He worked hard to keep this place financially afloat. If you ask me, I think somebody killed him to 
  keep him quiet about something." 
  30 "Nurse Retch" TM_NO_LINE "Ooh, girl. She's a piece of work. She got in professional trouble a few years ago and Northrup 
  got her out of it. Ever since, she's his attack dog. You stay away from her. Rumor is her brother's a hitman for the local 
  mafia."
  00 304 "Nurse Becky" TM_NO_LINE "She's a sweetie. This is her first job out of nursing school and the patients love her."
  00 303 "Buzz" TM_NO_LINE "The security guy? He couldn't outrun me. And I'm 82 with a titanium hip."
  00 300 "'Throbbing Loins of Nantucket'" TM_NO_LINE "Ooh, girl. That one's a personal favorite. I do like my sea captains muscular and sweaty.
    It's almost as good as that one about the stable boys." 1 
  00 301 "'Shirtless Stable Boys of Madison County'" TM_NO_LINE "She fans herself. Don't get me started, girl. And that book you brought me last week about 
    the vampires? She gives a 'chef's kiss'." 302
  00 302 "'You Had Me at 'Blah''" TM_NO_LINE "Ooh, girl. I do like 'em pale and stringy."

  30 "St. Asterix Hospital" TM_NO_LINE "It's a job, I guess. I don't expect this place to last much longer."
  30 "Dr. Northrup" TM_NO_LINE "The big man? He runs the place. I hear a lot of complaining, though."
  30 "Sid Jorry" TM_NO_LINE "I dunno, man. I heard he and Northrup had been fighting about something lately. Now he's 
  dead? Just sayin'..."
  00 303 "Potassium Chloride" TM_NO_LINE "It's a good way to kill somebody. You inject them and their heart stops. 
  Nothing shows up in the blood because we're already full of potassium anyway."

  You've probably heard of us."
  30 "Dr. Northrup" TM_NO_LINE "I stay out of the big man's way and do what he tells me. Plus, that nurse friend of his scares 
  me." 304
  30 "Sid Jorry" TM_NO_LINE "The dead guy? He's in there. I didn't know him but I'm supposed to keep everybody out until the 
  cops get here. The blizzard is slowing them down. I did see that nurse who hangs with Northrup go in there for a while."  304
  30 "boombox" TM_NO_LINE "You like it? It takes, like, 12 'D' batteries, man."
  30 "mix tape" TM_NO_LINE "I dunno. This chick I'm hanging out with gave it to me. Some songs are OK. At least they keep me 
  awake."
  00 301 "Buzz" TM_NO_LINE "He's my boss. He's allright, I guess. He doesn't like to leave the security office."
  00 304 "Nurse Retch" TM_NO_LINE "I'm pretty sure she's killed people, dude. And I hear she's mafia-connected."

  30 "shrimp" TM_NO_LINE "Have to keep my strength up. All hell could break loose at any moment."
  30 "Sid Jorry" TM_NO_LINE "We found him dead in his office. The cops are on the way although it was probably just 
  a heart attack. The blizzard has held them up and I'm not sure when they'll get here."
  30 "Dr. Northrup" TM_NO_LINE "He's the hospital CEO. He always smells outstanding."

  00 303 "Mr. Johnson" TM_NO_LINE "Nice enough fellow. Had a joint replacement I think."
  00 304 "Elliot" TM_NO_LINE "He likes to flirt with me so I think his knee is feeling better."

Wheels grinding and squeaking, you push the cart south.

Main Lobby
This is the main lobby and hospital entrance. The wall to the south is mostly
glass including the large double doors leading out. The windows are partially
iced over and through them you can see gales of wind-driven snow blowing
sideways. An information desk occupies the north wall.

Mabel is here, occupying the information desk. She's an elderly lady who
volunteers at St. Asterix. Currently, she's manning the information desk. She
would have gone home hours ago but the blizzard left her stuck here. She sees
you enter and waves with a smile. 

Mabel sees the cart you're pushing. "Let's see here. Which one of these trashy
things haven't I read?" She giggles a bit and plucks one from the cart. "Ooh,
look at the pecs on that hunk of sugar," She picks up a book titled 'Throbbing
Loins of Nantucket'.

"Ooh, I almost forgot. Take this."
She pulls a flashlight from the folds of her layers and hands it to you.

"You may need this tonight if the blizzard causes a brown-out. I sure do wish
I'd gotten myself out of here and home before they closed the roads."

Security Office
This cluttered office smells vaguely of old pizza and sour-cream potato chips. A
bank of closed-circuit monitors lines one wall, although none of them are turned
on or seem to be functional. A long desk fronts the monitors. It's ringed with
water stains and burger wrappers. The exit lies to the east.

Buzz, the head of security, is sitting at the desk. He's engrossed in the
newspaper and intermittently reaches over and blindly plucks a shrimp from a
bowl and plops it into his mouth.

On the security desk you can also see a security card and a bowl (which contains
a bowlful of shrimp). 

Mabel is off to the east.

> show shrimp to buzz
Buzz's eyes widen at the sight of the shrimp.
"Ooh, thought you could get away, huh?"
Before you can react, he plops the shrimp in the bowl with the others. 

Buzz plucks a shrimp from the bowl and plops it into his mouth.

Suddenly, he freezes and beads of sweat break out on his expansive forehead. A
loud wet gurgling sound emanates from his large stomach. Frantically, he bolts
up and with shocking dexterity, dashes out of the room and disappears.

Mabel is off to the east.

zag up and down to the floors above and below.

Freddy is here. He's the narcoleptic third-shift security guard. Hiring someone
with a sleep-disorder who could nod off at any moment to work the overnight
shift seems less than ideal. His uncle is on the hospital board but that's
probably just coincidence.

south, a placard on it reads "Central Supply".

Eugene is here. He's the overnight custodian. He waves and stops when he sees
you. "Hey, Candy. I brought a tape for your little tape player. It's on my desk.

Environmental Services
This is a cluttered storage room. The walls are lined with shelves stocked with
cleaning supplies, brushes, and brooms; most of which you don't need to concern
yourself with. A tall but narrow brown metal cabinet stands in one corner. A
battered full-length metal locker faces it on the other side of the room. A
black telephone is mounted on the wall. The exit lies to the south.

This is a large basement filled with dusty crates and defunct antique equipment.
There are scattered low-wattage lamps hanging from the ceiling but most of these

projected onto the cement walls. An impossible tangle of pipes and conduits
hangs from above. The only exit lies through a metal door to the north.

opening, the bore of which is about two feet across. As in the other room, a
large red warning sign is posted to the wall warning of the dangers of the
strong metallic field. A thick window in the east wall allows a view into the
control room. There's a small hatch in the floor next to the scanner, presumably
to allow service access. You can return west to the control anteroom.

coiled around a bleached twisted branch at one end. A squat black safe sits in
one corner. 

The former Sid Jorry is sitting in the chair and slumped over the desk. His
eyes, thankfully, are closed.

It appears that somone has been in here already and cleaned out the room.

volunteers at St. Asterix. Currently, she's manning the information desk. She
would have gone home hours ago but the blizzard left her stuck here. She sees
you enter and waves with a smile. 

Mabel sees the cart you're pushing. "Let's see here. Which one of these trashy
things haven't I read?" She giggles a bit and plucks one from the cart. "Ooh,
look at the pecs on that hunk of sugar," She picks up a book titled 'Throbbing
Loins of Nantucket'.

"Ooh, I almost forgot. Take this."
She pulls a flashlight from the folds of her layers and hands it to you.

bank of closed-circuit monitors lines one wall, although none of them are turned
on or seem to be functional. A long desk fronts the monitors. It's ringed with
water stains and burger wrappers. The exit lies to the east.

Buzz, the head of security, is sitting at the desk. He's engrossed in the
newspaper and intermittently reaches over and blindly plucks a shrimp from a
bowl and plops it into his mouth.

On the security desk you can also see a security card and a bowl (which contains
a bowlful of shrimp).

MRI Suite
This white sterile room is largely empty save for the large white cylinder of
the MRI machine. A similarly white long narrow table is positioned at the
opening, the bore of which is about two feet across. As in the other room, a
large red warning sign is posted to the wall warning of the dangers of the
strong metallic field. A thick window in the east wall allows a view into the
control room. There's a small hatch in the floor next to the scanner, presumably
to allow service access. You can return west to the control anteroom.

cops leave. I'll have a chat with our careless associate later."

She hangs up the phone and walks to the metal cabinet in the corner. She looks
around then pulls on the door handle which won't open. She grunts angrily then
balls up a fist, striking a specific spot on the door which pops open.

corner and a file cabinet in another. The room smells vaguely of pipe smoke and
a plush leather executive chair is here next to the desk. 

Nurse Retch is here. 

You can also see Dr. Northrup here.

You seem to have interupted the start of an animated conversation between Dr.
Northrup and Nurse Retch. They abuptly clam up as you enter.

"Ahh, the candystriper I've heard about. The one poking around into things that
have nothing to do with her; things she doesn't understand; things she may be
misinterpreting?"

He smiles for a moment and then his face hardens.

"I don't know what you think is happening here, young lady. But I believe you
need a letter signed. And now that poor Mr. Jorry has passed away, that
signature comes from me. Currently, I'm not feeling much like signing anything."


He turns to Nurse Retch.

"I think we'd best have a talk with our mutual friend. And you, my dear, need to
leave."

Northrup motions to the door and you step out into the hallway. He and Nurse
Retch follow and Northrup closes and locks the office door behind him. He and
Retch quickly leave to the east and disappear down the dark hallway.

the sounds of a tape-recorder motor and then a voice, distorted and speaking a
bit too excitedly into the microphone.

"Hello, my name is Sid Jorry. I am CFO of St. Asterix hospital. I plan to mail
this to you because I have information you may find interesting pertaining to
possible financial misdealings perpetrated by Dr. Walt Northrup, CEO of the
hospital."

He clears his throat awkwardly and you hear paper rustling.

"It seems the good doctor has been siphoning money from the hospital with the
expectation that it would fail. At the same time, Dr. Northrup has become a
shadow investor in the company that owns the hospital building and grounds."

He pauses and you hear what sounds like drinking from a glass.

"The hospital is likely worth much more as real estate than as a hospital and
its failure would be a windfall for several powerful people. I have records of
all of this in a ledger locked in my safe. To delay Northrup from finding it, I
have secretly swapped safes with him. My safe is now in his office. The
combination is 19, 20, 21.

You hear a heavy "thump" and a cough.

"If anything happens to me, it's almost certainly not an accident and this
information should be given to the proper authorities."

Then there's a loud "click" and empty hissing. You press 'stop'.

One more night. One more cold winter night. It's been a painful four weeks but
you're SO close you can taste it. And then Mr. Rogers, your Ethics teacher can
suck it.

You're going to be a senior and you have BIG plans coming up this summer.
Tiffany is going to be life-guarding at the pool and she's promised to get you a
cushy job at the snack bar. You'll spend your working days surrounded by cute
boy lifeguards and your off-time at the mall.

But then your grades started to slip and, inconceivably, the topic of summer
school has come up. To avoid this at all cost, you took Ethics 101 this
semester, an easy "A". But, in order to pass, you have to perform some sort of
volunteer activity for four long painful weeks. The concept of mandatory
volunteerism seems odd to you but, nonetheless, here you are, working as a candy
striper at St. Asterix Hospital, the oldest and most run-down hospital in the
city.

It hasn't been too bad. You mainly push the book cart around so patients can
pick out a book or magazine. Tonight's your last night and your sponsor at the
hospital, Mr. Jorry, was supposed to sign your letter tonight confirming your
volunteer hours after you get the signatures of 9 patients and staff. But
rudely, Mr. Jorry has been found dead in his office. And, even worse, a blizzard
blew in tonight and now it doesn't seem like you can even get home.

Mr. Jorry may have been killed and the killer may still be in the building,
trapped inside by the storm. But, more importantly, you are NOT going to summer
school this year and you'll unmask a murderer if you have to in order to get
those signatures.

Main Lobby
This is the main lobby and hospital entrance. The wall to the south is mostly
glass including the large double doors leading out. The windows are partially
iced over and through them you can see gales of wind-driven snow blowing
sideways. An information desk occupies the north wall.

Mabel is here, occupying the information desk. She's an elderly lady who
volunteers at St. Asterix. Currently, she's manning the information desk. She
would have gone home hours ago but the blizzard left her stuck here. She sees
you enter and waves with a smile. 

Mabel sees the cart you're pushing. "Let's see here. Which one of these trashy
things haven't I read?" She giggles a bit and plucks one from the cart. "Ooh,
look at the pecs on that hunk of sugar," She picks up a book titled 'Throbbing
Loins of Nantucket'.

"Ooh, I almost forgot. Take this."
She pulls a flashlight from the folds of her layers and hands it to you.

"You may need this tonight if the blizzard causes a brown-out. I sure do wish
I'd gotten myself out of here and home before they closed the roads."

Security Office
This cluttered office smells vaguely of old pizza and sour-cream potato chips. A
bank of closed-circuit monitors lines one wall, although none of them are turned
on or seem to be functional. A long desk fronts the monitors. It's ringed with
water stains and burger wrappers. The exit lies to the east.

Buzz, the head of security, is sitting at the desk. He's engrossed in the
newspaper and intermittently reaches over and blindly plucks a shrimp from a
bowl and plops it into his mouth.

On the security desk you can also see a security card and a bowl (which contains
a bowlful of shrimp). 

Mabel is off to the east.

> show shrimp to buzz
Buzz's eyes widen at the sight of the shrimp.
"Ooh, thought you could get away, huh?"
Before you can react, he plops the shrimp in the bowl with the others. 

Buzz plucks a shrimp from the bowl and plops it into his mouth.

Suddenly, he freezes and beads of sweat break out on his expansive forehead. A
loud wet gurgling sound emanates from his large stomach. Frantically, he bolts
up and with shocking dexterity, dashes out of the room and disappears.

Freddy is here. He's the narcoleptic third-shift security guard. Hiring someone
with a sleep-disorder who could nod off at any moment to work the overnight
shift seems less than ideal. His uncle is on the hospital board but that's
probably just coincidence.

This is a cluttered storage room. The walls are lined with shelves stocked with

yourself with. A tall but narrow brown metal cabinet stands in one corner. A

large red warning sign is posted to the wall warning of the dangers of the
strong metallic field. A thick window in the east wall allows a view into the

This is a typical office befitting a less-than-top-level executive. A desk
stands here as well as a rolling leather executive chair. Non-threatening
paintings of flowers and bowls of fruit adorn the walls. A large glass aquarium
sits on a stand directly behind the desk. Sand covers the bottom and a snake is
coiled around a bleached twisted branch at one end. A squat black safe sits in
one corner. 

The former Sid Jorry is sitting in the chair and slumped over the desk. His
eyes, thankfully, are closed.

It appears that somone has been in here already and cleaned out the room.

cops leave. I'll have a chat with our careless associate later."

She hangs up the phone and walks to the metal cabinet in the corner. She looks

This is the western end of a long east-west hallway. It's a bit better

Northrup's Office
This is a large office belonging to Dr. Walter Northrup, the president and CEO
of the hospital. An imposing mahogany desk dominates the room and large wooden
bookshelves line the walls. The walls are adorned with the requisite paintings
and the floor is covered in thick beige carpet. A black safe squats in one
corner and a file cabinet in another. The room smells vaguely of pipe smoke and
a plush leather executive chair is here next to the desk. 

Nurse Retch is here. 

You can also see Dr. Northrup here.

You seem to have interupted the start of an animated conversation between Dr.
Northrup and Nurse Retch. They abuptly clam up as you enter.

"Ahh, the candystriper I've heard about. The one poking around into things that
have nothing to do with her; things she doesn't understand; things she may be
misinterpreting?"

He smiles for a moment and then his face hardens.

"I don't know what you think is happening here, young lady. But I believe you
need a letter signed. And now that poor Mr. Jorry has passed away, that
signature comes from me. Currently, I'm not feeling much like signing anything."


He turns to Nurse Retch.

"I think we'd best have a talk with our mutual friend. And you, my dear, need to
leave."

Northrup motions to the door and you step out into the hallway. He and Nurse
Retch follow and Northrup closes and locks the office door behind him. He and
Retch quickly leave to the east and disappear down the dark hallway.

You climb the creaky metal ladder nearly to the top. Once there, you are able to

the sounds of a tape-recorder motor and then a voice, distorted and speaking a
bit too excitedly into the microphone.

"Hello, my name is Sid Jorry. I am CFO of St. Asterix hospital. I plan to mail
this to you because I have information you may find interesting pertaining to
possible financial misdealings perpetrated by Dr. Walt Northrup, CEO of the
hospital."

He clears his throat awkwardly and you hear paper rustling.

"It seems the good doctor has been siphoning money from the hospital with the
expectation that it would fail. At the same time, Dr. Northrup has become a
shadow investor in the company that owns the hospital building and grounds."

He pauses and you hear what sounds like drinking from a glass.

"The hospital is likely worth much more as real estate than as a hospital and
its failure would be a windfall for several powerful people. I have records of
all of this in a ledger locked in my safe. To delay Northrup from finding it, I
have secretly swapped safes with him. My safe is now in his office. The
combination is 19, 20, 21.

You hear a heavy "thump" and a cough.

"If anything happens to me, it's almost certainly not an accident and this
information should be given to the proper authorities."

Then there's a loud "click" and empty hissing. You press 'stop'.

cannisters on it start to shake violently. As the noise crescendos, the
cannisters take flight and dart though the air toward and around the MRI scanner
itself, each one a small missile bashing into the white tube and smashing the
safety glass of the door and window. Keeping your wits about you, you duck down
into the compartment, shutting the hatch behind you. Above you, you hear
screaming and the dull "thump" of hard metallic things smacking into soft fleshy
things. After a moment, there's a pained moan from the MRI scanner and the
screeching winds down and then you hear only eerie silence.

Serendipitously, several police officers enter the room, powered snow still
dusting their caps and coats. Soon, thanks to your sleuthing, Retch, Vic, and

                print "This is the hospital's small morgue. The white tiled floor is scuffed and gently slopes toward a drain in the center of the
                room. The walls are also clad in featureless tiling and a pair of flickering fluorescent tubes above you impart a sickly green 
                ambiance. A stainless steel table sits in the center of the room and one wall is occupied by a bank of refrigerated
                lockers. A door lies to the west.^^
                A body is lying on the steel table.^";
